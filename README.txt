TA builds:
	Run the swagger server using "ant server" - runs on localhost:8081
	Run the demo client using "ant client" - the swagger server must be running for this to work

Catana builds:
	Run our server using "ant our-server"
	Run our client using "ant our-client"
	Run our junit tests using "ant test" - This is in the test.xml file (We need to merge with ta's build.xml for this to work)
